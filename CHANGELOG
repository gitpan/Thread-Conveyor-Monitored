0.04	7 August 2002
	Added "private" default optimization setting, instead of the one
	from Thread::Conveyor.

	6 August 2002
	Fixed problem in shutdown which would cause deadlocks when using
	belts optimized for memory.

	5 August 2002
	Added many more test-cases to the test-suite.

	Added DESTROY method and clone sensing logic, because a shutdown
	method is now available.

	Added method "shutdown" for an orderly shutdown of the monitoring
	thread.  You should now not call method "put" with the exit value
	anymore.  Instead you should call method "shutdown".

	Added method "tid" to obtain the thread id of the monitoring thread.

	The "new" method now only returns the instantiated object.  If you
	want access to the monitoring thread, you should obtain that with
	the new "thread" routine.

	Made the Thread::Conveyor::Monitored object stand-alone with a
	Thread::Conveyor::xxx object in its belly.  Added access methods
	so that they apply to the belt rather than the object itself.  This
	makes the Thread::Conveyor::Monitored::Throttled module obsolete:
	it is now removed from the distribution.  Added documentation for
	all of these new features.

	Upgraded to be able to use (and required) newest Thread::Conveyor.

0.03    1 August 2002
	Changed required version of Thread::Conveyor to 0.04.

	Fixed problem in "new" when using an existing, unthrottled belt.

	Fixed problem in test-suite cause by the new ::Throttled sub-class
	of Thread::Conveyor.

0.02	31 July 2002
	Added Thread::Conveyor::Monitored::Throttled almost empty sub-class 
	for handling throttled monitored conveyors.

	Adapted documentation to reflect the new "maxboxes" and "minboxes"
	fields and modules.  Adapted test-suite as well.

	Adapted makefile.PL to require Thread::Conveyor 0.03.

	Adapted "new" to allow for "maxboxes" and "minboxes" settings now that
	Thread::Conveyor can be throttled.

0.01	25 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Conveyor::Monitored, which started life as
	Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored.
